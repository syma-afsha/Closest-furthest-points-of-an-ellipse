### Closest-furthest-points-of-an-ellipse

Implement the algorithm that computes the closest/further point of an ellipse with respect to a given 2D point. The input of the method is a 2D point, represented by coordinates u and v. 

Step 1: Generate random ellipse parameters and draw the ellipse and the randomly selected 2D point. 

Step 2: Develop the method from [this PontEllipseDist webpage](https://cv.inf.elte.hu/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/PontEllipseDist.pdf)

Step 3: Insert the closest/further points and the corresponding line segments into the plot.
